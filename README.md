# Statistical-Learning

The main purpose of this research is to apply what was learned from the class of Statistical Learning for Data Science to practice. In other words, combining theoretical knowledge of Linear Methods for Regression, Additive Models, Trees, and Boosting, the research can solve practical issues in the field of data science.

Question answering is an important NLP task and a longstanding milestone for artificial intelligence systems. The ability to read a piece of text and then answer questions about it is called reading comprehension.  Reading comprehension is challenging for machines, requiring both understandings of natural language and knowledge about the world.

In practice, the dataset used is Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) from a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable. 

For this research, the most specific section is to use fundamental methods to figure out the problem, since the SQuAD is famous with all big companies trying to jump up at the leaderboard and using advanced techniques like attention-based RNN models to acquire the best accuracy. In general, methods of Multinomial Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost will be applied to the traditionally NLP problem. Apart from the approach of analysis, a new method of sentence embedding and how to be used for building a Question Answering System will be introduced in the processing of the context, especially essential for the feature engineering.
